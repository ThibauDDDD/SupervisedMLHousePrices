# SupervisedMLHousePrices
create a python script that can predict the prices of an house from the database.

I got the database from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview.

On the terminal, run python house_prices.py, and you will see the results from the pdf graphics, and the result for the true test from the file submission.csv

the graphics pdf shows 2 differents methods to predict the prices. 
The submission csv shows the predicted price from the test.csv file. I submitted this file to the kaggle competition for this dataset and got  the score 0.16728, witch is good, but not amazing.
